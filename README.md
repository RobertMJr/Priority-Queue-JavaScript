## Description
In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type similar to a regular queue or stack data structure in which each element additionally has a "priority" associated with it.

### [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)
While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are conceptually distinct from heaps.

A priority queue is a concept like "a list" or "a map". Just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or an array, a priority queue can be implemented with a heap or a variety of other methods such as an unordered array.

This priority queue is implemented with a binary heap.
